# Overview
Welcome to our micro-mouse project. This project is about a robotic design which is required to complete a maze. It uses infrared light to detect obstacles on its path. Design and implemantation of power and sensor subsytems for the micromouse robot  focusing on efficiency and strict budget constraints is entailed.

# Subsystems
## Power Subsystem
Description: Responsible for powering the entire system, including motor driving, battery charging, and providing battery state of charge information.\
Testing: Verify functionality through acceptance tests
## Sensor Subsystem
Description: Detects and senses objects in the maze environment.\
Testing: Ensure accurate object detection and reliable sensor data.
## Usage
Refer to the documentation and README files within each subsystem directory for detailed usage instructions.

# Structure
- Datasheets/: Contains datasheets providing detailed information about the components used in our project, helping you understand their specifications and characteristics.
- KiCAD/: This directory holds all the KiCAD files, including schematics, project files, and PCB files, giving you insight into the hardware design and layout of our subsystems.
